  <p>I visited Singapore last year and went back home after just 3 days.
That might not seem crazy to you, but it should after I tell you 
that Singapore is 12,000 kilometers away from my hometown in Croatia.</p>

<p>This happened because of one of my biggest shortcomings - saying
yes too much. I accepted traveling to Singapore and staying there
for a week in order to get to know the project and the team I&#39;m gonna
be working with. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know anything about the project, except that it&#39;s a <em>fintech</em> 
startup. This raised red flags to my friend Dino, who warned me that
it might not be a good project and that I can find better. My reaction
was <em>&quot;Meh, how bad can it be?&quot;</em>. Turns out it can be
pretty bad.</p>

<p>I ended up flying over there not knowing where I am staying until I landed. 
That was the first red flag to me and seeing that I got accommodated in a room
without proper windows was the second. The third was seeing what the project
was about. I&#39;m not a fan of <em>fintech</em> and working with numbers too heavily and
this project turned out to be a bunch of expandable and collapsable tables. 
Glorified Excel spreadsheets in its nastiest form.</p>

<p>After realising all this, I started panicking. Combined with that was the 
jet lag which prevented me from getting any sleep at night. I started thinking
about quitting that job and staying there until the return flight they paid for.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like the idea too much. There are a bunch of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I couldn&#39;t find an ATM for my crappy Maestro card, so I had a fixed amount of
money on me</li>
<li>the weather was killing me</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t like their food</li>
<li>I was alone</li>
</ul>

<p>All things considered, I decided to pay an extra $900 and return 
home after just 3 days. Asian plane tickets are crazy. I&#39;ve taken two-way
ticket from Croatia for ~ $900 and here I had to pay $900 for just one way.</p>

<hr>

<p>This was my $900 lesson from Singapore and the main thing I learned is to stop
saying <em>yes</em> too much. The second thing I learned is that it&#39;s great to be 
prepared and know your accommodation if you&#39;re going on a 12,000km trip.</p>
