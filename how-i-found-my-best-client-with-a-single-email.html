      freelancing

  </div>
  <p>I&#39;m currently freelancing for a client that&#39;s a lot better than any other client I&#39;ve had in the past, so my best client [<a href="#best">1</a>], and I&#39;ve only sent one cover letter. </p>

<p>The secret? Meticulously filtering clients that don&#39;t match my criteria.</p>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s not the only thing I did differently this time - that cover letter took a lot of time to write, compared to how I&#39;ve written my cover letters before that, and it paid off tremendously. </p>

<p>The thing that pushed me to change how I approach finding new clients was the realization of two facts. The first is the fact that the quality of clients varies dramatically. The second is the fact that my happiness and life satisfaction depends a lot on how I spend most of my waking hours and my perception of the usefulness of the activity. With these two facts in mind, I decided to be more deliberate when it comes to finding new clients. Minimizing the &quot;luck factor,&quot; undoubtedly at play whenever finding any type of job, was another thing that pushed me to be more systematic. I didn&#39;t want to leave things to chance - my life satisfaction depended on it.</p>

<p>I then began to define my ideal client, which is basically the same thing as company defining an ideal customer. It makes sense that it&#39;s analogous since freelancing can be viewed as selling my &quot;software development product.&quot;  The first question that came to mind was: &quot;What does my ideal client do?&quot;.</p>

<p>I tried to answer that question by asking myself what I enjoyed doing the most. I realized that the most fulfilling activity for me was building new products. Making the things someone drew, also known as design mockups, come to life and seeing it being used by people - that&#39;s the real magic for me. So my ideal client would have to be in the early stage or build new products in one way or another.</p>

<p>After that, I moved to: &quot;What size is the company?&quot;. This was a no-brainer for me. The smaller, the better; the smaller the size, the bigger the impact I have.</p>

<p>Then I asked myself another one: &quot;What technology do they use?&quot;. I used to give a lot of importance to this question, filtering out clients that didn&#39;t match my criteria of technologies I consider &quot;hot&quot; at the moment. Realizing that bad clients can use &quot;hot&quot; technologies too, made me rethink how much importance this question has. I knew they had to use Ruby, but I didn&#39;t add any other requirements there, which means I didn&#39;t set any requirements for the frontend technology of choice - in my case React. The reason for this is because I think that there are a lot of more projects that use React, although they shouldn&#39;t, then there are projects that do not use it, although they should. This made me assume that React was not a requirement that would be of any benefit.</p>

<p>After writing those three answers, which were the must-have requirements, I started to look for new job postings on the sites I regularly use for that. This was happening while I was finishing my work on the project I was currently working on. Knowing the project will end soon and that I&#39;ll have to find a new client after that, pushed me to start looking for new clients earlier than I would usually. It took a month of searching for something until I stumbled upon the job opening that matched all my criteria and had this in the description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We promote a distraction-free work environment. Our work style is modeled after 37signals successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! Since I really enjoyed not having to use Slack on the last project I worked on, this sparked my interest. </p>

<p>Chat has become the thing I really hate a lot since it bombards me with mostly unimportant notifications and makes me feel like I&#39;m missing out when I disable the notifications. Having read &quot;Deep Work&quot; by Cal Newport crystalized my opinion even more against the use of a chat as a primary communication tool. </p>

<p>Reading that they&#39;re modeling their work style after Basecamp was music to my ears because I&#39;m very familiar with Basecamp&#39;s stance on distractions and chat.</p>

<p>So I have decided to write them an email, in which I have described how much I appreciate their encouragement of distraction-free work and how it aligns with my perceptions of an ideal work environment. This was not written in a style of a formal cover letter, in which you try to present your achievements in the best possible way. It merely described why I think we&#39;re an excellent match for each other.</p>

<p>The interview stage followed, in which I&#39;ve also done something different than before [<a href="#interview">3</a>]. I tried to find as much as possible about the company and then wrote questions I had for them, which would be used for me to decide whether we are a match or not.</p>

<li><a name="best"></a> Everyone has a different idea about who their ideal client is since everyone has different priorities and goals. No techonology is a silver bullet that should be used in every scenario, and likewise no client is the best client for everyone. Being systematic about picking the best client for yourself, by making a profile of them, is a great way to find them.</li>
<li>It&#39;s interesting how common constant distraction has become in the modern work environment. Mobile devices are the worst offenders here.</li>
<li><a name="interview"></a> Any interview should be perceived as a conversation in which both parties try to determine if they are the right fit for each other. </li>
