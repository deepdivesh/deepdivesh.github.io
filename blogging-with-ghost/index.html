  <p>I&#39;ve been switching blog engines a lot lately. Currently I&#39;m using the latest hotness on the block, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some observations after trying it out.</p>

<h2>what is great</h2>

<p>One of the main selling points of Ghost is definitely a very sexy UI. It comes with a great theme and feels very snappy and clean. I&#39;m currently under impression that blogs need to have that minimalistic feel, have no distractions and be up to the point. This was probably influenced by <a href="http://mdeiters.svbtle.com/all-our-coderwall-are-belong-to-you">Svbtle</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/how-to-solve-creative-problems-a463ec2c2cb7">Medium</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">open source</a>, of course, and it&#39;s 100% JavaScript - Node and Ember form a wonderful combination here. Reading its source code will definitely teach you a lot, so go ahead.</p>

<p>It comes with a snappy Casper theme, which you can see in action on the <a href="http://john.onolan.org/">Ghost&#39;s author blog</a>. I&#39;ve switched from it since I don&#39;t like defaults and I love the look of feel of Medium, so I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/starburst1977/readium">Readium</a>.</p>

<h2>what could be better</h2>

<p>Since Ghost is a node application, the authors are expecting you to run it on a server capable of running node. As we all know, hosting costs money and I think it&#39;s not necessary for blog to be an actual web application. Instead, it could just be a collection of static pages and I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> because of that. I&#39;ve used it with every blog engine I&#39;ve tried. They are pretty awesome and completely free.</p>

<p>There is no official support for this, though, so I&#39;m currently using a <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">curl hack</a> as a workaround. It does a fine job, as you can see.</p>

<p>The fact that blog posts are saved in a database is another thing that&#39;s itching me. I might be biased with this, because of the problem I have with the upper mentioned scenario, but I love using plain old filesystem as a storage for my posts. Markdown is beautiful and completely open, why prefer databases over it? With Markdown on a filesystem, it&#39;s really easy to switch blog engines and since I&#39;m now officially a <em>blog-engine hopper</em>, I consider it important.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to just rant about it here, this is something I&#39;m planning to change. If that sounds interesting to you, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/shimetweets">reach me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Two heads are better than one.</p>

<hr>

<p>All in all, I really love Ghost - it&#39;s the best blogging experience I&#39;ve had. Go ahead and try it out, you won&#39;t be disappointed!</p>

<p>I&#39;m surely sticking with it for some time.</p>
