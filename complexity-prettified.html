  <p>Ruby community is influenced with Rails opinions of conveniences and conventions. Ruby became popular through Rails and its huge influence is unsurprising. Popularity of DSLs among Rubyists is also unsurprising.</p>

<p>DSLs improve expressiveness, but it comes with a price. They add a layer of complexity that comes naturally with implicit code. Instead of providing truth, they provide convenience. DSL is essentially a syntactic sugar that takes you away from the actual implementation.</p>

<p>Strive for the expressiveness of that narrow public facing API, instead of faking it with pretty DSLs on top. We are Rubyists, damn it - we understand Ruby. The forgotten language buried deep inside your overly expressive castle of syntactic sugar.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t throw all DSLs into a volcano for the time being, they are still pretty useful if their domain of usage is small. Any sort of configuration is a perfect scenario for using a small DSL. Just keep in mind that any kind of convenience comes with a price, a price that not everyone is willing to pay.</p>
