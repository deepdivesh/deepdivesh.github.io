<p>I&#39;ve been freelancing remotely for the past six years. Here are some of the things
I&#39;ve learned over the years.</p>

<h3>Work in your own timezone</h3>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been mostly working for US-based startups I am constantly under
pressure to have a big overlap with their time zone. It&#39;s easy to relent under
such pressure and effectively switch time zones. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working for a year in a San Francisco time zone, starting my day at
5 pm and going to sleep at 3am. It&#39;s not healthy and I would not recommend it
to anyone. It&#39;s just not worth it, don&#39;t do it.</p>

<h3>There are better clients and projects out there</h3>

<p>If you feel that this is not a project that matches your interests or skills, don&#39;t
be afraid to ditch it and search for a better project or client. There&#39;s always a better
and worse client than your current one. It might take some time and luck to find 
a better match, but time spent searching for better matches is definitely worth it.</p>

<h3>Say no more often</h3>

<p>Knowing your boundaries is a key for a healthy relationship with your client. Saying
no takes character, but it makes your client respect you more. Know when to say no
in order to prevent yourself from being spread too thin. </p>

<p>Saying no to some things allows you to say yes to other things. Say yes
to things that matter.</p>

<h3>Be strict about your work schedule</h3>

<p>Knowing when your work day starts and when it ends is key to having a healthy
work-life balance. Be strict with yourself. This is one of the biggest 
problems with freelancing - you&#39;re your own boss when it comes to deciding
if the work day is over or not. Be a good boss to yourself and set the 
working hours strictly. </p>

<p>Routine stuff like daily standups help since they are always happening
at the same time. I currently have one standup at 10am, so I usually start my
working day with it.</p>
