  <p><em>This post is inspired by <a href="https://michaelsoolee.com/love-vim-again/">Falling in love with Vim again</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelsoolee">@michaelsoolee</a>.</em></p>

<p>I love Vim. I&#39;ve been using it for a long time
for bascially everything. I&#39;m writing code locally in it, use it in ssh 
sessions remotely and yes, I&#39;m writing this post in it.</p>

<h2>The power of Vim and beginner friendliness</h2>

<p>The thing I like the most about it is its grammar.
For me that&#39;s the most powerful part of Vim.
No modern editors have figured this out yet, but the fact that
you can combine verbs and nouns into commands is what makes 
the difference. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t suggest Vim to beginners. The reason behind this is
the fact that Vim operates in <em>modes</em>, which makes it
unintuitive to open the file and edit it. Not to mention
exiting Vim. If you&#39;re just getting started with programming
and are searching for a solid editor, I&#39;d recommend <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>.
It&#39;s free, really intuitive, configurable, comes with syntax highlighting and
has a large community providing an endless number of plugins.</p>

<h2>Dotfiles</h2>

<p>The really cool part of Vim is seeing how other people use it,
which is made possible by the configuration file Vim uses, which
people can share online, in their dotfiles. <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dotfiles&type=Repositories">Github search for that term</a>
will give you a lot of repositories to look into for inspiration.
Dotfiles are not just for Vim, they are a powerful tool for saving
entire environment. From zsh/bash configuration to git configuration
to Vim configuration, it&#39;s all saved there. You can test someone else&#39;s 
environment configuration by making a new user locally and cloning the 
dotfiles repo, symlinking those configuration files. If you still don&#39;t have
it you should consider making a dotfiles repo and storing your settings
there. By doing that you&#39;ll no longer have to worry about losing
your settings if something happens to them locally. </p>

<h2>My Vim workflow</h2>

<p>This is what my Vim looks like.</p>

<p><img src="/public/current-vim.png" alt=""></p>

<p>These are my decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>font is 18pt Inconsolata</li>
<li>theme is a customization of <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a></li>
<li>no line numbers, they are a distraction</li>
<li>minimal file details at the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>no plugins that take too much space like NerdTree</li>
<li>branch info is visible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Three plugins I use the most frequently</h2>

<p>Here are the plugins I use the most, sorted by the frequency of use.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a></h3>

<p>Used for switching between files. Say no to NerdTree.</p>

<p><img src="/public/ctrlp.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve configured it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span></span><span class="c">&quot; Set CTRL-P to ignore anything matching this regex</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_custom_ignore <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;DS_Store\|tmp\|node_modules&#39;</span>

<span class="c">&quot; Set CTRL-P to lookup files based on regex, instead of basename only</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_regexp <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span>

<span class="c">&quot; Set CTRL-P working directory to the first ancestor directory that contains .git/</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_working_path_mode <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">2</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>2. <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">unimpaired</a></h3>

<p>Also used for switching between files. This is used when files 
are in the same directory. Typing <code>[f</code> and <code>]f</code> is really fast.</p>

<p><img src="/public/unimpaired.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://github.com/rking/ag.vim">ag.vim</a></h3>

<p>Used for searching for text inside a project.
It uses <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">the silver searcher</a>,
a replacement for grep under the hood.</p>

<p><img src="/public/ag.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Notice how I use <code>[q</code> and <code>]q</code> to navigate between results. Here&#39;s my configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span></span><span class="c">&quot; Tell ag.vim to stop using regex search</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ackprg <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ag --nogroup --nocolor --column --literal&#39;</span>

<span class="c">&quot; Abbreviate ag to Ag</span>
cabbrev ag Ag

<span class="c">&quot; Map CTRL+A to Ag</span>
map <span class="p">&lt;</span>C<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> :Ag 

<span class="c">&quot; Search for word under cursor with ag</span>
<span class="nb">noremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>Leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">a</span> :Ag <span class="p">&lt;</span>cword<span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that&#39;s it, those are the most essential plugins I would recommend.
Other than those plugins, I use <code>&lt;C-o&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;C-i&gt;</code> to navigate between files a lot.</p>

<hr>

<p>I use Bower as a package manager for my Vim plugins,
since it&#39;s the package manager that allows Github repos as package locations
and I&#39;ve found that most of Vim plugins are hosted on Github. No changes are
required on the repo for it to be acceptable by Bower. It&#39;s great because
it lets you keep a JSON file of the list of plugins you use in your dotfiles 
repo.</p>

<p>As an example of how a vimrc file looks after a couple of years of use 
you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/shime/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc">my vimrc</a>. For plugin suggestions take look at <a href="https://github.com/shime/dotfiles/blob/master/bower.json">all the plugins</a> I use.</p>
