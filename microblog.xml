      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet has drastically reduced the cost of information distribution which lowered the barriers to entry causing the flood of “fake news” and spamming with content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes detecting bullshit and critical thinking vital to using the internet (possibly the greatest tool ever created) right, since there are no filters anymore. The burden for detecting useful/non-useful and fake/real has completely moved to an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This widens the gap between the educated and the non-educated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. Took me a while. I&amp;#39;ve already made an attempt to move away from Twitter and tried Mastodon before. Ditched it shortly after since it didn&amp;#39;t feel right. This looks much healthier!&lt;/p&gt;
