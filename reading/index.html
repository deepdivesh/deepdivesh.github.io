    I love reading books.
  </div>

  <div class='description' style="text-align: left">
    I didn't use to, but since buying a Nook
    the amount of books I've read
    has increased significantly.

    I read non-fiction almost exclusively. I mostly 
    read about psychology, productivity and
    philosophy.
  </div>

  <div class="description" style="text-align: left">
    Here's the list of my favorite books,
    which I hope you will enjoy as much
    as I did.
  </div>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people.jpg' alt='How to win friends and influence people' />
  <small class="description">A must read for anyone dealing with people in their day to day work (everyone). Packed with great advice for effective work relationships. Although its title might suggest so, this isn't a self-help book.  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/the-talent-code.jpg' alt='The talent code' />
  <small class="description">This book explores how brains work and how we reach our peek performance in both sports and art. Sheds some light on reasons behind talent pools like Brazil in soccer, Renaissance Florence in art, Russia in woman tennis etc.</small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/stop-stealing-dreams.jpg' alt='Stop stealing dreams' />
  <small class="description">Great critique of our current education system and how it's obsolete for the modern age. Explores history behind modern schools and lays out the problems they cause.</small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/hackers-and-painters.jpeg' alt='Hackers and painters' />
  <small class="description">
    Although my first thought about this book was that it's going to lay out the differences between painters and programmers, this book explores the similarities between them. Interesting read for any programmer out there, although some chapters are mildly annoying with extreme libertarian agenda.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/the-pragmatic-programmer.jpg' alt='The pragmatic programmer' />
  <small class="description">
    If I had to pick one book for every programmer to read, it would be this book. Packed with great advice from people that spent decades in software development.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/mastery.jpg' alt='Mastery' />
  <small class="description">
    Exploration of what it takes to become a master. In this book, the author describes lives of famous masters of their craft like Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein and explains how finding your niche is key to becoming master.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/outliers.jpg' alt='Outliers' />
  <small class="description">
    This book describes how most people are only interested in what talented people are like and completely ignore the fact of their environment and the time they were born at. It explores how the environment affected the success of many people we consider talented like Bill Gates and the Beatles.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/to-have-or-to-be.jpg' alt='To have or to be' />
  <small class="description">
    Great book that describes two modes of existence: the being and the having mode. It lays out the problem of the pointlessness of having mode and just acquiring things and suggests to reader to focus more on the being mode. A must read for anyone displeased with consumerism of our age.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/the-obstacle-is-the-way.jpg' alt='The obstacle is the way' />
  <small class="description">
    If you're looking for an introduction to Stoicism, start with this book. It explains how Stoics view obstacles in life as opportunities and how many successful people in history followed the Stoic philosophy to get through difficult times in their lives.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/a-power-governments-cannot-suppress.jpg' alt='A power governments cannot suppress' />
  <small class="description">
    A book that explores current political situation in the US. It concludes how civil disobedience is the key to democracy and is telling the truth about war and politics, being anti-war. It also gives criticism on celebrated US heroes like Columbus.
