  <p>I&#39;ve been a Ruby developer for some time, but I&#39;m recently getting pulled into the vortex of streams and modules called Node.js.</p>

<p>I might not come back and if that happens, here are some reasons.</p>

<p>I want programming computers to be like coloring with crayons and playing with duplo blocks.

<h2>404 hype not found</h2>

<p>There is little to say about this, after these great <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2013/02/nodejs-hatred-reveals-significant.html">blog</a> <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2012/02/rails-went-off-rails-why-im-rebuilding.html">posts</a> by Giles Bowkett.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that in order to become better programmer, I need to have open mind for things I haven&#39;t tried yet. I need to experiment.</p>

<p>By having more experiences with weird, unexplored stuff I become better. Hype has a negative connotation for me, so it&#39;s here to prevent me from that - therefore it&#39;s not desirable.</p>

<p>I try to pretend hype doesn&#39;t exist, as I gain nothing from it.</p>

<h2>modules all the way down</h2>

<p>GNU/Linux is an operating system I&#39;ve been using a lot and I really like all <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">the philosophy behind it</a>. Node was inspired by Unix, but mostly  with these two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</li>
<li>Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ryan Dahl&#39;s quote above is just a playful rephrasing of these rules. That&#39;s basically a Node&#39;s mantra and it&#39;s even more evident if you browse around on <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> a little or when you read the source code of <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/torrent/blob/master/cli.js">some libraries</a> written by prominent Node people. It feels like they use a lot more requires than we do, in the Ruby land.</p>

<p>The modules are also very minimalistic and they tend to be single-purpose libraries, which leads to this look of dependency graphs, representing the <a href="http://www.yasiv.com/npm#view/dat">structure of Node ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>There are some attempts to achieve the same in Ruby, of which <a href="http://microrb.com/">microrb.com</a> is the most evident one. It isn&#39;t very popular at the moment, but I&#39;m hoping it will be in the future, as Rails starts getting more competitors like <a href="https://github.com/lotus/lotus#readme">Lotus</a>. Yes, it needs more competitors. Rails currently thinks it&#39;s alone in the kingdom and I would like to see some changes with that.</p>

<h2>community</h2>

<p>I&#39;m under impression that Node people are much more relaxed about computers and rules than Ruby people. Maybe I&#39;m exaggerating a bit, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giS-aIq0Kaw">Dominic Tarr</a> reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giS-aIq0Kaw">Why the lucky stiff</a>. Maybe it&#39;s just because they&#39;re both disguised, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much obsession with TDD/BDD/DDD in the Node land and that is a great thing. We are programmers, god dammnit - we shouldn&#39;t be obsessed with things. We should be allowed to break them!</p>

<p>I&#39;m under impression that there&#39;s a lot less drama around everything here, everything feels more laid back. No one will dramatize if you write a Unix tool like <code>sed</code> or <code>awk</code> in Node. Do whatever you want, we don&#39;t care. After being a Rails developer for some time, this feels very refreshing.</p>

<h2>gems vs modules</h2>

<p>Since there are a lot of mad scientists in the kingdom of Node, it&#39;s common to stumble upon things with bugs and even unmaintained things. I think this is where Node community needs to learn from Ruby community, where you&#39;ll find so many awesome people dedicated to maintenance of a vastly used gem.</p>

<p>Node is a cutting edge technology, so playing with it comes with that cost, but there are two faces of that medal. You&#39;ll also develop a skill of module picking over time - something I&#39;ve not experienced that much in Ruby. In Ruby you rarely have to think twice before choosing the right gem for your problem, but here it&#39;s common to see dozens of modules for the same thing. That&#39;s probably because of the tendency for node modules to be much smaller in size than Ruby gems - it&#39;s much easier to provide alternatives.</p>

<p>Because of all this, you&#39;ll become more intimate with modules you use and you&#39;ll start recognizing authors whose packages are worth a require.</p>

<h2>node is weird</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s admit it - Ruby is not weird anymore. People don&#39;t do crazy things in it and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the reason why. Maybe those conventions and rules influenced our thinking and have put our minds inside the box?</p>

<p>It kinda feels like Java now, everyone going crazy about OO patterns, code cleanliness and 100% test coverage. Is that the most important thing? When did we forgot how to play?</p>

<p>Go and make something crazy! Node people <a href="http://studio.substack.net/r-experiments">are good at this</a>.</p>

<p>There is also another side to this medal, of course. I have zero experience with running Node.js in production, but I&#39;m guessing it will be harder than with Rails. That&#39;s okay, I like challenges in things I know nothing about.</p>

<h2>the future</h2>

<p>Things that are happening in Node and JavaScript right now are the things that are blowing my mind. I think that&#39;s the biggest reason why I&#39;m attracted to it so much. I think I&#39;ve got a little bored with Ruby since it&#39;s the only language I&#39;ve worked with for years.</p>

<p>My plan is to stick with something that is blowing my mind - I think that&#39;s the right path to improve myself. It used to be Ruby some while ago - now it changed to Node.</p>

<p>I know this post is biased and it&#39;s reasonable because I&#39;m excited the most with trying new things. Node is not the silver bullet, but I currently enjoy playing with it. Maybe I&#39;ll change my mind, like with Rails - maybe I won&#39;t.</p>

<p>At least I&#39;ll be richer for a fun experience.</p>
