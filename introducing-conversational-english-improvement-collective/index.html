  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I&#39;m assembling a team of people that would work on their conversational English. If you&#39;re a native speaker,
this is not for you -- sorry.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the past couple of months I&#39;ve realized that my spoken English has gotten a little rusty over the years.</p>

<p>I guess having zero English classes during college has that effect on your skills. Before I started looking for paid courses in spoken English, I admitted to myself that I probably don&#39;t want to enforce any new liabilities when it comes to this and that I would prefer talking over Google Hangouts much more.</p>

<p>It removes the requirement of being in the room physically with a teacher which makes everything more flexible.</p>

<p>But do I need a teacher?</p>

<p>What if I assemble a small team of people that have the same problem as I do and want to work on fixing it, over the wire? What if instead of talking about some boring default theme with my teacher, I could find people that share the same interests with me and are excited to talk about hacking and technology?</p>

<p>This is where I need <strong>you</strong>, my dear non-native English speaker!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about Ruby, Node.js, JavaScripts, Unixes, Open Source, crypto currencies, internets, cat herding and other interesting stuff while improving our conversational English at the same time!</p>

<p>The plan is to have an hour-long Google Hangout once or twice a week. We would discuss interesting topics, listed above and share our points of view in a friendly debate. I&#39;m still not sure how big the team would be...</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking about having around 20 people that would then mingle to make smaller teams that would participate in one hangout. You could give ideas about what you would like to talk about on a hangout and others would join you if they find it interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking for novice English speakers, but for people who are excellent in written English and very good in spoken English, but want to get to the native-speaking level. My biggest problem with spoken English is that I don&#39;t use it enough day-to-day since I live in Croatia, a country where English is not the official language.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, please <a href="https://twitter.com/shimetweets">get in touch on Twitters</a> or mail me your bio and why you would like to participate at <a href="mailto:shime@imap.cc">shime@imap.cc</a>.</p>

<p>Strangers take precedence!</p>
