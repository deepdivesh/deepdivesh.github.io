  <p>I&#39;ve killed two products I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of time
building. I&#39;ve wasted hundreds of hours
this way. The clichéd &quot;at least I&#39;ve learned something&quot; is my only consolation.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;ve learned.</p>

<h2>Lesson one</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180324070111/https://zapsnap.io/">Zapsnap</a>,
a temporary peer to peer screenshot sharing application, is the first product I&#39;ve made,
with design by <a href="https://twitter.com/benjam1n">@benjam1n</a>.</p>

<p>I was totally hyped about <a href="https://webtorrent.io/">Webtorrent</a>, Node.js, P2P web and
wasn&#39;t happy with the current screenshot sharing tools. Building some tool
that would combine all fascinations with pains I&#39;ve felt was a logical step forward.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve spent a lot of hours developing it, bought the domain, $10/mo server on Digital Ocean
and it was ready for some users. Users? That&#39;s right, I haven&#39;t talked
to anyone but friends about what I&#39;ve been building, so I didn&#39;t have a lot
of potential users to share my launch with.</p>

<p>Enter Product Hunt.</p>

<p>Product Hunt is a great place for sharing what you&#39;ve built
with people if you don&#39;t have an audience. It&#39;s much better for getting first users
than Hacker News unless you&#39;re targeting the Hacker News niche. People on Product Hunt
are generally more interested in trying new products. I launched it there and it ended in <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/zapsnap">second place for
that day</a>. Here are some numbers:</p>

<p><img src="/public/zapsnap.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Retention is another story, you&#39;ll generally get a spike in the number of users, but
you have to have a plan for actually keeping the users using your product. The above
graph has basically fallen to zero after the launch. It probably happened because I didn&#39;t
spend any amount of time on engaging with my users. I have sent zero emails, literally.
Another thing that led to this was probably the fact that people didn&#39;t find the 
product that interesting and useful, after getting familiar with it.</p>

<p>Zapsnap was a classic &quot;just fucking do it&quot; approach exercise. I was scratching
my own itch, but I didn&#39;t talk to anyone else to find out if this
product was even needed. Friends generally supported me, but I think they did it
out of kindness. This is definitely not a way to go since you can&#39;t
validate your ideas this way.</p>

<p>Building a totally free product was another mistake. I&#39;m lucky Zapsnap didn&#39;t take off 
because <strong>popular free products cost more money than unpopular free products</strong>. Hosting gets more expensive,
support takes more time, etc. With paid products, on the other hand, popularity
is a good thing, given that you have a solid monetization strategy.</p>

<p>Offering something useful in exchange for money isn&#39;t something you should be afraid of and it&#39;s 
the best validation tool for your product. People are okay with paying for useful things.</p>

<h2>Lesson two</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180103183734/https://journmail.com/">Journmail</a>,
an application that reminds you to write one sentence per day, is the
last product I&#39;ve made, with design by <a href="https://twitter.com/vblazenka">@vblazenka</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve built this product in an attempt to improve my consistency
while writing just one sentence per day in a journal. Having learned
the &quot;free product&quot; lesson from Zapsnap, I&#39;ve <em>planned</em> to start charging
for this product from day one. I didn&#39;t end up doing it, though. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of time developing it, bought domain,
$10/mo server on Digital Ocean and then I&#39;ve faced my biggest obstacle.</p>

<p>After figuring out how to implement recurring billing with PayPal, I&#39;ve faced another problem
with invoicing and accounting. I needed to figure out how to handle this sort of thing
with my company here in Croatia, even <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/what-billing-and-invoicing-tools-are-available-for-eu-based-saas-products-4cdabf8dea">asked people on Indie Hackers about it</a>, but ended up not doing anything.</p>

<p><strong>Billing and invoicing ended up being the most complicated part of Journmail</strong>. It was the last
thing I needed to finish before the launch and I was keen on reaching that finish line, so I&#39;ve
decided to ditch the billing and invoicing and launch a free product. I&#39;ve figured
I&#39;d make it free for early adopters and then make it paid when I find time to implement it.
Looking back, I don&#39;t think this was such a great idea <sup>[<a href="#trial">1</a>]</sup>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/journmail">launched it on Product Hunt</a>, but it
didn&#39;t end up being as successful as Zapsnap there. Product Hunt drove this traffic: </p>

<ul>
<li>~350 users that signed up</li>
<li>~200 receiving daily reminder emails</li>
<li>~20 users actually writing that one sentence per day every day</li>
</ul>

<p>As with Zapsnap, I didn&#39;t engage with users, other than sending that automatic one email
reminder per day.</p>

<p>Journmail was another &quot;just fucking do it&quot; exercise. Learned nothing from Zapsnap in this regard.</p>

<h2>The killing part</h2>

<p>So with having these two free products on autopilot, each costing $10/mo I&#39;ve heard about the GDPR and 
figured I don&#39;t have time to implement any changes needed for compliance.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I decided to shut both of them down. I&#39;ve made another mistake here, didn&#39;t send 
an email with an apology to Journmail users (Zapsnap users didn&#39;t give me an email) and just shut it down
overnight.</p>

<p>GDPR and lost interest in maintaining free products was what drove me to shut both of them down. </p>

<h2>The point</h2>

<p>We have a saying in Croatia - <em>&quot;Every school costs money&quot;</em>. These lessons have cost
me a lot of time and some money, so hopefully, this saves some of your time and money.</p>

<li><a name="trial"></a> A better idea would&#39;ve been to
make it free to try out with a trial period of 30 days. This would&#39;ve given
me time to implement the billing system while keeping people aware that
it was not free. This approach <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/504347479932825600">was pioneered by folks from Basecamp</a>.</li>
