  A list of books I would recommend for anyone to read.

  <small class="description">A must read for anyone dealing with people in their day to day work. Packed with great advice for effective work relationships. Although its title might suggest so, this isn't a self-help book.  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/the-talent-code.jpg' alt='The talent code' />
  <small class="description">This book explores how brains work and how we reach our peek performance in both sports and art. Sheds some light on reasons behind talent pools like Brazil in soccer, Renaissance Florence in art, Russia in woman tennis etc.</small>

</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/hackers-and-painters.jpeg' alt='Hackers and painters' />
  <small class="description">
    Although my first thought about this book was that it's going to lay out the differences between painters and programmers, this book explores the similarities between them. Interesting read for any programmer out there, although some chapters are mildly annoying with libertarian agenda.
  </small>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/the-pragmatic-programmer.jpg' alt='The pragmatic programmer' />

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/outliers.jpg' alt='Outliers' />
  <small class="description">
    This book describes how most people are only interested in what talented people are like and completely ignore the fact of their environment and the time they were born at. It explores how the environment affected the success of many people we consider talented like Bill Gates and the Beatles.
  </small>
</section>

<section class="book">
  <img src='/public/to-have-or-to-be.jpg' alt='To have or to be' />
  <small class="description">
    Great book that describes two modes of existence: the being and the having mode. It lays out the problem of the pointlessness of having mode and just acquiring things and suggests to reader to focus more on the being mode. A must read for anyone displeased with consumerism of our age.
