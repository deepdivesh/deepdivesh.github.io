  <p>World wide web is such a great medium. Its impact is gaining momentum every single day and I couldn&#39;t be more happy about it. I&#39;m convinced it will replace all other mediums and it is a <a href="http://theratchet.ca/what-is-the-global-brain">global brain</a> of sorts. Transparency is probably why I like it the most and I&#39;m under impression that most of the society is not aware how important role transparency plays in our lives.</p>

<p>Open source is closely related to transparency. I know exactly what I&#39;m using and therefore I can alter it to fit my needs. If I&#39;m interested, I have the opportunity to learn about all of the details because the details are just hanging around and waiting for my set of eyes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing all of this on an open source operating system, using the open source editor to enter this markdown, which will be outputted into the web-friendly format by a little help of the open source blog engine, which will in fact get hosted on the open source repo provided to me for free.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that amazing?</p>

<h2>What are you talking about, I don&#39;t even</h2>

<p>I mean, there are a lot of projects online involving really clever people who are building stuff that&#39;s changing the world. They are not only helping people to get stuff done, but also sharing their knowledge with everyone who is interested.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, for example. It has been an immense stack of knowledge bits, carefully partitioned into Q/A pairs, waiting to help others with the same problems. I&#39;m infinitely thankful for such a great service and it doesn&#39;t ask for anything in return, other than my optional beans of wisdom. Not only do I feel like a hero when my little beans help someone on the other part of the globe with their problem, but I also get rewarded for it. I get certain reputation points. It amazes me how great concept this is.</p>

<p><a href="http://try.discourse.com">Discourse</a> is the new cool thing I would like to get involved in. Let&#39;s admit it, the most of the forums today are still stuck in the 90&#39;s. They all look and feel the same, so I&#39;m excited to see Discourse setting the future of forums. I&#39;ve only known about it since I started to learn JavaScript MVC framework, called <a href="http://emberjs.com">EmberJS</a>. Discourse, <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">being an open source project</a> has been a great aid for me in the world of Ember, because I can refer to its source code when things get messy. Being able to see how Robin Ward, known as <a href="http://eviltrout.com">Evil Trout</a>, solves Ember problems has taught me a lot. He also posts some great learning stuff on his blog, so if you&#39;re also learning Ember, make sure to check it out.</p>

<p><a href="http://travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a> is another example of a vibrant open source project. I haven&#39;t managed to find time to check its Ember <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web">source</a>, but I&#39;m sure I could also learn a lot of interesting stuff.</p>

<h2>The other side</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m aware of plenty of sites which are exactly the opposite of the aforementioned ones. They&#39;re usually utility sites, aimed to help a certain group of people. More often, than not, they are related to some political institution or they represent a government agency of some sort.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of shitty websites is the public transportation sites, at least in my experience. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the experience in other cities or countries, but in Croatia it&#39;s unbearable. People are, kind of, used to the shitty websites when they need some sort of public service on the web. They are n aware that things can be improved a lot, but seeing same pages over and over again for a long period of time has had the effect of minimizing the problem.</p>

<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>If you have any programming experience for the web, you might want to give it a shot and try to build something better. It will not only help others and reward you in eternal glory, but it will also make your life a lot easier!</p>

<p>Why not help your fellow citizens, if you have the knowledge?</p>

<p>Imagine learning new interesting language or framework while helping other people at the same time! Building interesting new stuff and solving problems you&#39;ve never experienced before makes you a better programmer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you don&#39;t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow &amp; exclude people. So create.</p>

<p><cite>Why The Lucky Stiff</cite></p>

<p>Instead of ranting about the poor user experience, why not revolutionize it?</p>

<p>To wrap it up, don&#39;t expect the world to change by itself. <em>Be that change!</em></p>
